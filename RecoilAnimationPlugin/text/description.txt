Long description:

Please, read the description carefully before purchasing this product!

C++ knowledge is not mandatory. However, it's strongly reccomended to have at least basic understanding of Blueprints to work with the plugin. Also, the asset doesn't provide shooter mechanics (e.g. aiming, different fire modes etc.) - it's only about animation.

PRAS is a plugin, which makes firearms animation much faster and easier. With the help of curve based solver, it's possible to achieve high-quality results, without using third party software. Code-driven approach makes it possible to save memory budget, modify animation on the fly and make animations look unique each shot.

Don't want to create a lot of animation sequences? Then, PRAS is the right choice for you.
